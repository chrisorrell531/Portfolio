# Portfolio
My software development portfolio:

1. 24/10/2017 - Creating A Mathematic Dll (C#). - This is a DLL file called "MathCore" which won't actually run, because it is just a dictionary of functions if you will. To see the scripts inside this project please look inside "MathCore/MathCore". To see the mathematics library, it is lots of basic mathematics functions that take two inputs in the function and return the output.
2. 24/10/2017 - Using A Mathematics DLL (C#). - This will take use of the Mathematics DLL we created. To see the scripts inside this project please look inside "UsingTheLibrary/UsingTheLibrary". To see the running version of the maths library, the console application written in C# performs most of the methods inside the mathematics DLL. It also does some basic error checking and data type conversion.
3. 18/05/2018 - Creating A First Person Shooter (FPS) Style, Camera Look Script and Movement Script (C#). To see the scripts inside this project please look inside "Unity-FPSCameraAndMovementSystem/Assets". Please be aware with the different version of the Unity Editor this worked on 2019.3.14f1, I havent tested on other Unity versions, and havent built the final version.
