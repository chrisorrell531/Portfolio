# Portfolio
My software development portfolio:

1. 24/10/2017 - Creating A Mathematic Dll (C#). - This is just a DLL file called mathcore it wont actually run but please look at the code inside "MathCore/MathCore". to see the mathematics library, it is just lots of basic mathematics functions that take two inputs in the function and return the output.
2. 24/10/2017 - Using A Mathematics DLL (C#). - This will take use of the Mathematics DLL we created  please look in inside "UsingTheLibrary/UsingTheLibrary". to see the running version of the mathematics library, the console application written in C# performs most of the methods inside the mathematics DLL it also does some basic error checking and data type conversion.
