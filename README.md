# Portfolio
My software development portfolio:

1. 24/10/2017 - Creating A Mathematic Dll (C#). - This is a DLL file called "MathCore" which won't actually run, because it is just a dictionary of functions if you will. Please look at the code inside "MathCore/MathCore". To see the mathematics library, it is lots of basic mathematics functions that take two inputs in the function and return the output.
2. 24/10/2017 - Using A Mathematics DLL (C#). - This will take use of the Mathematics DLL we created. Please look inside "UsingTheLibrary/UsingTheLibrary". To see the running version of the maths library, the console application written in C# performs most of the methods inside the mathematics DLL. It also does some basic error checking and data type conversion.
